# Guidance Updates

This is the canonical user-readable change history for the integer declared in
`SKILL.md`. Use it to explain what changed before asking about a historical
audit. These entries do not themselves authorize released-history edits.

## Guidance 1

Established complementary customer and developer changelogs, outcome-focused
public wording, release-aware `Unreleased` handling, metadata alignment, and
nearby raw-markdown attribution.

Repositories with history predating this guidance could choose whether to
reconstruct or review that history. Prospective work followed the guidance even
when the historical review was declined or deferred.

## Guidance 2

Moved all durable decisions into the repository-local
`.simple-changelogs.json` policy. Installed packages no longer carry per-repo
state, so one installation can serve unrelated repositories safely.

Made initial setup require both changelog files and one recorded historical
audit disposition. Guidance prompts stop repeating for a version once a
disposition is recorded; an unanswered prompt records nothing and may be asked
again later. Unfinished or failed audits resume only when explicitly requested.

Added stored authorization for missing release-note destinations. Existing
destinations may stay synchronized during release work, while product UI and
internal operator surfaces require explicit current authority or documented
policy plus an authorized audience.

Replaced human-form attribution with a portable HTML comment whose identity and
timestamp may truthfully be `unreported`. Clarified that signatures are useful
metadata rather than proof of authorship or filesystem changes.

Corrected initial-development terminology: a `0.x.y` version is not inherently
a SemVer pre-release; suffixes such as `-beta` or `-rc.1` identify pre-releases.
Publicly distributed `0.x` products keep routine repair notes quiet while still
disclosing material trust, access, payment, safety, compliance, onboarding, or
data-loss outcomes.

Clarified that a local fork wins by repository convention, not through a
guaranteed loader capability, and bundled deterministic evaluation and fork
checking helpers with the installed package.

## Guidance 3

Added stable-major release synthesis. Version `1.0.0` now curates the durable
capabilities and stability promise established during public `0.x` development,
while later major releases explain the transition from the latest stable prior
line, including breaking changes and required migration.

Separated next-major development from stable-major finalization. Branch names
such as `v2` are supporting evidence only, and alpha, beta, or release-candidate
versions follow the repository's published version convention without being
mistaken for the stable major release. Public prerelease history remains intact
when the stable release is synthesized.

An approved historical audit may identify stable-major summaries that omit a
material migration or misstate the release boundary. Preserve released
headings and detailed history unless the audit separately authorizes a
meaning-changing correction under `references/backfill.md`.
