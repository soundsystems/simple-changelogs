# Developer Changelog

## 2026-06-17

- Published the skill in the canonical Skills CLI catalog layout:
  - Moved the skill to `skills/simple-changelogs/SKILL.md`.
  - Added README install commands for `bunx skills add` and `pnpx skills add`
    from the GitLab URL.
  - Verified the Skills CLI can discover the skill from the public GitLab repo.
- Added bootstrap and git backfill guidance:
  - Documented how agents should create missing `CHANGELOG.md` and
    `DEVELOPER_CHANGELOG.md` files.
  - Added release-boundary, paginated-history, and batching instructions for
    backfills.
  - Added guidance to summarize outcomes instead of copying one entry per
    commit.
